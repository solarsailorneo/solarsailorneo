## Purpose
To use the skills I have learned in my career to contribute to the development of web3.0. I want to build creative but secure smart contracts to leverage functionalities that add value to the global community.


## Education
- M.S. in Robotics - [Carnegie Mellon - Robotics Institute](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/) [2015-2017]
- B.S. in Mechanical Engineering - [University of Florida](https://mae.ufl.edu/mechanical-engineering/)  [2011-2014]


## Projects (Engineering: 7 years | Development: 4 years)

### [Digital Avatar Identity](https://github.com/solarsailorneo/digitalAvatarIdentity) (ERC725Y Contract) [2022] ([git](https://github.com/solarsailorneo/digitalAvatarIdentity)) [[workflow](https://github.com/solarsailorneo/digitalAvatarIdentity/network)]
- Built a smart contract with a key that can store multiple retrievable attributes on-chain.
- Built tests in hardhat and mocha to verify functionality of contract.



### [Multi Token Standard](https://github.com/solarsailorneo/mulitTokenStandard) (ERC1155 Contract) [2022] ([git](https://github.com/solarsailorneo/mulitTokenStandard)) [[workflow](https://github.com/solarsailorneo/mulitTokenStandard/network)]
- Built a smart contract that inherited from the ERC1155 standard.
- Designed constructor so that a number of tokens can be set when deploying the contract.
- Built test in hardhat and mocha to verify that the number of tokens were minted to the deployer wallet.

### [NFT Minter](https://snazzy-horse-8858d0.netlify.app/) (ERC721-Based Contract and Frontend) [2022] ([git](https://github.com/solarsailorneo/minterNFT)) [[workflow](https://github.com/solarsailorneo/minterNFT/network)]
- Built a react frontend to mint NFTs.
- Built and deployed an NFT-minter contract in the Rinkeby testnet.
[0xdebe8510ecb716408513c90a454416dc6dc79869](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0xdebe8510ecb716408513c90a454416dc6dc79869).

### [TestCoin](https://github.com/solarsailorneo/testCoinICO) (ERC20 Contract) [2022] ([git](https://github.com/solarsailorneo/testCoinICO)) [[workflow](https://github.com/solarsailorneo/testCoinICO/network)]
- Built and deployed a smart contract for a test coin in the Rinkeby testnet.
[0xCabfb905163A197931a88CBc226ea230007333Dc](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/token/0xCabfb905163A197931a88CBc226ea230007333Dc).
- Created a liquidity pool for TestCoin in Uniswap.

### [Shared Wallet](https://github.com/solarsailorneo/sharedWallet) (Contract) [2022] ([git](https://github.com/solarsailorneo/sharedWallet)) [[workflow](https://github.com/solarsailorneo/sharedWallet/network)]
- Built a wallet that has an owner who can set allowances for other wallets.
- Used modifier functionality to contain pre-function conditions.

### [Token Crowdsale](https://github.com/solarsailorneo/tokenCrowdsale) (Contract) [2022] ([git](https://github.com/solarsailorneo/tokenCrowdsale)) [[workflow](https://github.com/solarsailorneo/tokenCrowdsale/network)]
- Built a custom token that can be initially sold to a group of people.
- Reentrancy-guard was used to prevent hacking of the crowdsale.
- Used truffle deployment and chai tests to verify functionality.

### [Venetian Election DAO](https://darling-nasturtium-65b4bd.netlify.app/)  (Frontend and Backend) [2022] ([git](https://github.com/solarsailorneo/venetianElectionDAO)) [[workflow](https://github.com/solarsailorneo/venetianElectionDAO/network)]
- Designed a DAO wallet-election system based on the venetian election process (random/election rounds).
- Built a react frontend for the designed election system leveraging a Moralis github repository.
- Built a nodejs backend to compute the selection process.
- Maintained my git repository with clean and coherent versioning, tags, commits, branches, and merging (copied repo to kill the trace. Ask for a screen share if want to see).

### [NFT Transaction Tracker](https://vermillion-sfogliatella-6b7bdb.netlify.app/) (Frontend) [2022] ([git](https://github.com/solarsailorneo/eventDetectorNFT)) [[workflow](https://github.com/solarsailorneo/eventDetectorNFT/network)]
- Built a react front-end with NFT contract input field to track transfers.

### NFT cross-asset Model [2021-present]
- Built a power-law model that used population proxies and community strength in order to arrive at NFT “fair” valuations [Excel].
- Extrapolated and verified the model with other asset classes like Bitcoin, Ethereum, US houses, and gold.
- Built a demographic model in order to verify and bound the value-prediction of NFTs to remain under what is humanly possible [Excel].

### Bitcoin Trading Algorithm [2019-2020]
- Built an algorithm based on price and volume that would automatically buy and sell Bitcoin through Robinhood [python, Robinhood API].

### S&P500 Machine Learning Model [2019]
- Built a machine learning model to classify whether the S&P would go up or down based on price, volume, and volatility historical time series [python, pytorch library].
- Made visual 3d plots to analyze price, volume, and volatility asset profiles to understand how the data works from a human perspective [python, pandas library].

### Lidar Security System (Pointcloud Clustering and Machine Learning) [2019-2022]
- Designed and implemented a data-processing pipeline in order to label 5000 pointclouds per day for machine learning training [C++, bash].
- Implemented various custom neural networks to classify our data in real-time in a jetson-xavier NX platform. Initial classification performance was 10 Hz. Improved performance to 40 Hz [python, pytorch, C++, CUDA, TensorRT].

### 5-degree-of-freedom Robotic Arm [2018-present]
- Designed a Multi-input Multi-output controller algorithm for a 5 degree-of-freedom manipulator (6 linked bodies). [C++]
- Multithreaded and modified pointcloud registration algorithm resulting in a 6X performance improvement. [C++]
- Massively parallelized pointcloud registration algorithm. [CUDA]
- Derived the math and implemented forward and inverse kinematics of 6 linked bodies. [C++]
- Derived and implemented first order dynamics (inertia, gravity, and centripetal coriolis) of manipulator. [C++]

### Team Management for Isaac SDK [2019]
- Managed a team of two engineers whose job was to incorporate our existing code into the Isaac library framework [C++, Isaac Library].
- Scheduled project milestone meetings which were to the point and efficient.
- Helped the engineers with tasks whenever they needed me to step in.
